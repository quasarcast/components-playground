Watch [the video here](https://youtu.be/zWqJvO4bR_0).

Want to learn all of Quasar's components? You're in the right place!
"Quasar Takeoff" is the ultimate Quasar playground! It's an interactive dev environment that has all the learing videos built in.

It's really cool, I think you'll love it ðŸ’™

Here's a quick "how to" to get you started...

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Jump into `src/scratchpads` and start learning!
When you're dev servers up and running, jump into the `src/scratchpads` directory. The components in this directory match up with the ones you'll see in the app.
